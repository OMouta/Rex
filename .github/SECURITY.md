# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Rex, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it privately to the maintainers:

- Email: [YOUR_EMAIL_HERE]

We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to resolve the issue. Responsible disclosure is appreciated.

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest stable release of Rex. Security fixes may not be backported to older versions unless critical.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is resolved, we will disclose the details responsibly and credit the reporter if desired.
